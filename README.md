# My Advent of Code Repo

2022 is the first year I took part in Advent of Code live.
Since I'm based in the UK, most of the code was written at *5 am*, so please don't judge too harshly.


In a way, the whole experience felt like taking a 'coding personality test'. Now I know that when in doubt and under time pressure, I resort to `for loops`, and my favourite part tends to be reading in and wrangling with messy data (how Data Science of me!).


In 2022, my favourite puzzle was Day 21, partly because I got to use `rlang` and partly because solving it felt very fun and intuitive (especially compared to previous days).


I primarily use R, but I plan to use Python in future puzzles!


I'm working through the previous years at my own pace.
